# VNCCS Pose Studio Usage Guide

`VNCCS Pose Studio` is an interactive 3D posing, body-shaping, camera, lighting,
render, and pose-library node for ComfyUI.

It is designed for workflows that need consistent character pose control images,
lighting prompts, camera framing, and reusable pose presets.

## Node Interface

Display name:

```text
VNCCS Pose Studio
```

Internal name:

```text
VNCCS_PoseStudio
```

Category:

```text
VNCCS/pose
```

Inputs:

| Input | Type | Visible | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `pose_data` | `STRING` | hidden | Main JSON state written by the custom Pose Studio UI. |
| `pose_image` | `IMAGE` | optional | Studio mode only. Runs SAM 3D Body image-to-pose import and applies the result to the frontend pose. Disabled in VNCCS Pose Manager mode. |
| `unique_id` | ComfyUI hidden | hidden | Used for backend/frontend synchronization. |

Outputs:

| Output | Type | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `images` | `IMAGE` list | Rendered pose image output. In LIST mode it is one image per pose tab. In GRID mode it is a one-item list containing the grid image. |
| `lighting_prompt` | `STRING` list | Lighting prompt aligned with `images`. |

Important backend behavior:

- The node requests a fresh frontend sync before execution when `captured_images` are not already present.
- If `pose_image` is connected in Studio mode, the backend runs SAM 3D Body, sends the imported pose back to the UI, waits for sync, and then renders the updated state.
- If `pose_data.export.interface_mode` is `manager`, `pose_image` is ignored and the frontend removes that input port.
- Captured image payloads are limited to 16 images, 64 MiB of base64 text total, 32 MiB decoded bytes per image, and 4096 x 4096 pixels per image.

## Main Modes

Pose Studio has three practical interface states:

| Mode | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Studio | Full editor: body sliders, 3D viewport, pose tabs, camera, lighting, prompt, import/export, and render settings. |
| Pose Manager | Gallery/grid view for pose review and management. The `pose_image` input is disabled here. |
| Manager Detail | Focused edit/detail view opened from Pose Manager. It is still manager context, so `pose_image` remains disabled. |

The mode is stored in `pose_data.export.interface_mode`.

## Quick Start

1. Add `VNCCS Pose Studio`.
2. Open the node large enough to see the embedded UI.
3. Pose the mannequin in the center viewport.
4. Set output dimensions in the export/camera controls.
5. Add or edit the prompt in the prompt panel.
6. Run the workflow.
7. Connect `images` to downstream image/control nodes.
8. Connect `lighting_prompt` to your text prompt composition if you want the rendered lighting described in text.

## Layout Overview

### Left Panel

The left side contains precision controls:

- Body and mesh proportions.
- Age, gender blend, weight, muscle, height.
- Female and male-specific body sliders.
- Head, limb, torso, hand/foot proportion controls.
- Model rotation controls.
- Camera dimensions, zoom, and offset controls.
- Export mode controls.
- Debug/render options.

Exact UI grouping may change as the web panel evolves, but all values are saved
inside `pose_data`.

### Center Viewport

The center is the interactive 3D editor:

- Select joints/bones directly in the viewport.
- Use FK/IK controls where available.
- Rotate, move, and reset pose elements.
- Use the frame preview to match the final render crop.
- Manage multiple pose tabs.
- Copy/paste pose states between tabs.
- Import poses from supported JSON/OpenPose/Mixamo paths through the UI tools.

### Right Panel

The right side focuses on prompt, pose library, and lighting:

- Pose Library button and modal.
- Per-pose prompt text.
- Lighting setup.
- Ambient, directional, and point light controls.
- Light position/radar controls.
- Lighting prompt generation state.

## Pose Tabs

Pose Studio can manage more than one pose in a single node.

Each tab stores:

- Bone rotations.
- IK/FK state where applicable.
- Model rotation.
- Camera params for that pose when saved.
- Per-pose prompt.

In LIST output mode, every pose tab becomes a separate output image and prompt
entry. In GRID mode, the node combines rendered poses into one grid image.

## Output Modes

### LIST

`LIST` is the default production mode for most ComfyUI workflows.

Behavior:

- Renders each pose tab separately.
- Returns `images` as a list of individual image tensors.
- Returns `lighting_prompt` as a list aligned to those images.

Use LIST when:

- You want a batch of pose/control images.
- Downstream nodes process each pose separately.
- You want individual prompts per pose.

### GRID

`GRID` combines all poses into one image.

Behavior:

- Renders each pose tab.
- Builds a grid using the configured column count and background color.
- Returns the grid as a one-item image list.

Use GRID when:

- You want a single pose sheet/contact sheet.
- You are building reference previews rather than separate generation inputs.

## Camera and Framing

Pose Studio stores camera settings in the `export` section of `pose_data`.

Common settings:

| Setting | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `view_width` / `view_height` | Output resolution. |
| `cam_zoom` | Camera zoom/framing. |
| camera offsets | Shift subject inside the frame. |
| model rotation | Rotate the mannequin without changing the viewport UI state. |
| background color | Used for final render and grid background. |

Tips:

- Use the preview frame to check the final crop.
- For pose-control images, keep the subject fully visible unless you are intentionally making a close-up.
- For grid sheets, choose dimensions and column count before final capture.

## Lighting and Lighting Prompts

Pose Studio renders a lit mannequin and can output a lighting prompt string.

Lighting controls include:

- Ambient light.
- Directional light.
- Point lights.
- Color and intensity.
- Light position.
- Radius/falloff-like controls for local lights.

The `lighting_prompt` output is intended to be appended to your generation
prompt. It is especially useful when you want image lighting and text prompt
lighting to agree.

## Pose Library

Pose Studio includes a local and repository-backed pose library.

Library features:

- Save current pose.
- Load a saved pose.
- Delete local poses.
- Browse pose cards with previews.
- Organize by repository and category.
- Store tags and metadata.
- Refresh enabled remote repositories.
- Publish local pose repositories to Hugging Face when configured.

Local pose metadata is stored inside each pose JSON under `_library`.

Default category:

```text
Uncategorized
```

Local user repository id:

```text
local_user_poses
```

### Saving Poses

When saving, Pose Studio writes:

- A pose JSON file.
- Optional preview image.
- Repository/category/tags metadata.

The save path is controlled by repository and category. Pose names are sanitized
to filesystem-safe names.

Current implementation detail:

- Preview data is prepared in a temporary file before replacing the final file.
- Pose JSON is written to a temporary file and installed with `os.replace`.
- This keeps normal save operations from leaving partial preview files behind.

### Remote Pose Repositories

Pose repositories are Hugging Face model repositories with a manifest:

```text
pose_library.json
```

The manifest contains pose entries with JSON paths, optional preview paths,
categories, and SHA256 hashes. During sync:

- Existing files are checked by SHA.
- Changed files are downloaded to temporary paths.
- Per-file download limit is 32 MiB.
- Total sync limit is 256 MiB.
- Files are only marked expected after successful validation/download.
- Stale local files are removed from the repository cache.

### Pose Sync Endpoints

The web UI and backend communicate through local ComfyUI routes:

| Route | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `/vnccs/pose_captures_upload` | Upload frontend-rendered captures for backend execution. |
| `/vnccs/pose_captures/{capture_id}` | Fetch cached captures. |
| Pose Library API routes under `/vnccs/pose_library/...` | Repository, save, load, delete, refresh, publish, and progress operations. |

These are internal workflow/UI routes. They are documented so users understand
where state comes from; they are not normally called by hand.

## Using `pose_image`

The optional `pose_image` input lets you drive Pose Studio from an input image.

Workflow:

1. Connect an `IMAGE` to `pose_image`.
2. Run the node in Studio mode.
3. Backend runs SAM 3D Body on the first image in the batch.
4. The imported pose is sent to the frontend.
5. The frontend applies the pose to the mannequin.
6. Backend waits for synced `pose_data`.
7. The node renders the updated pose.

Notes:

- `pose_image` is meant for Studio mode.
- It is disabled in VNCCS Pose Manager mode.
- If a saved manager workflow still sends `pose_image`, backend ignores it when `interface_mode` is `manager`.
- SAM 3D Body can take time on CPU. CUDA is preferred for SAM3D. BiRefNet masking can use XPU when `torch.xpu.is_available()`.

## SAM 3D Body Backend

Pose Studio uses the vendored `vnccs_sam3d` backend for image-to-pose import.

Model files:

```text
<ComfyUI>/models/sam3dbody/
  model.ckpt
  model_config.yaml
  assets/
    mhr_model.pt
```

If missing, the loader path can download from:

```text
jetjodh/sam-3d-body-dinov3
```

Device behavior:

- SAM 3D Body loader supports `Auto`, `CUDA`, and CPU-oriented fallback depending on the underlying code path.
- SAM3D itself is treated as CUDA-first and CPU fallback.
- BiRefNet uses CUDA when available, then XPU when available, then CPU.
- CUDA half precision is used only for CUDA in BiRefNet.

Standalone SAM 3D Body classes present in the vendored package:

| Display name | Internal class | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Load SAM 3D Body Model | `LoadSAM3DBodyModel` | Prepare/download SAM3D model config. |
| SAM 3D Body: Process Image to Pose JSON | `SAM3DBodyProcessToJson` | Convert image plus optional mask/hand crops to pose JSON. |
| SAM 3D Body: Setting Body Preset JSON | `SAM3DBodySettingBodyPresetJson` | Build reusable body preset JSON. |
| SAM 3D Body: Render Human From Pose and Body Preset JSON | `SAM3DBodyRenderFromPoseAndBodyPresetJson` | Render a human image from pose JSON and body preset JSON. |

In this repository version, the top-level ComfyUI registration exports the
VNCCS nodes listed in `MODEL_MANAGER_GUIDE.md`. The vendored SAM3D classes are
kept as the backend bridge and may be registered by dedicated SAM3D entrypoints
in environments that load them directly.

## Standalone SAM3D Node Reference

This section documents the SAM3D classes included under `vnccs_sam3d` for users
who expose or call them directly.

## Import and Interop Notes

Pose Studio web tools include import paths for:

- Pose Studio JSON.
- OpenPose-derived data.
- Mixamo FBX pose extraction through the bundled JS helper.
- SAM 3D Body image-to-pose import.

Because different sources use different coordinate systems, imported poses may
need manual cleanup. Recommended workflow:

1. Import pose.
2. Check hips/spine/shoulders first.
3. Fix hands and feet.
4. Adjust camera.
5. Save into the Pose Library with a clear category/tag.

## Recommended Workflows

### Single Pose Control Image

1. Add `VNCCS Pose Studio`.
2. Pose the body in Studio mode.
3. Set output mode to LIST.
4. Keep one pose tab.
5. Connect `images` to your ControlNet/OpenPose/reference path.
6. Append `lighting_prompt` to your text prompt if useful.

### Multi-Pose Batch

1. Create one tab per pose.
2. Set per-pose prompts if needed.
3. Use LIST output mode.
4. Run the workflow and process the image list downstream.

### Pose Sheet

1. Create multiple pose tabs.
2. Set output mode to GRID.
3. Choose grid columns and background color.
4. Run the workflow to get one combined sheet image.

### Image-to-Pose

1. Connect a source image to `pose_image`.
2. Stay in Studio mode.
3. Run the node.
4. Wait for SAM 3D Body import to apply to the UI.
5. Make manual corrections.
6. Save the result to the Pose Library.

### Pose Manager Review

1. Switch to Pose Manager.
2. Review pose cards in the grid.
3. Open a card for detail editing.
4. Return to Pose Manager when done.
5. `pose_image` is disabled in this mode to keep the manager focused on existing pose states.

## Limits and Safety

Frontend/backend payload limits:

| Payload | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Pose capture cache image count | 16 images |
| Pose capture cache total text size | 64 MiB |
| Decoded captured image | 32 MiB per image |
| Captured image pixels | 4096 x 4096 per image |
| SAM3D upload image | 32 MiB |
| SAM3D upload pixels | 4096 x 4096 |
| Mesh overlay JSON body | 32 MiB |

Pose Library repository sync limits:

| Item | Limit |
| --- | --- |
| Preview image | 16 MiB |
| Single repository file download | 32 MiB |
| Total repository sync download budget | 256 MiB |
| Sync capture JSON body | 64 MiB |
| Pose repository small API bodies | 1 MiB |

## Troubleshooting

### The node output is stale

- Pose Studio asks the frontend for a fresh sync before execution.
- If the frontend tab was refreshed or the node was duplicated, click inside the node UI once and run again.
- Save and reload older workflows after opening the node once.

### The UI is visible but renders do not match what I see

- Check output mode and output dimensions.
- Use the preview frame before execution.
- Make sure you did not leave Pose Manager mode when expecting Studio capture.

### `pose_image` is missing

- This is expected in VNCCS Pose Manager and Manager Detail modes.
- Switch back to Studio mode to restore the `pose_image` input.

### `pose_image` is connected but ignored

- Check `pose_data.export.interface_mode`.
- In manager mode, backend intentionally ignores `pose_image`.

### SAM3D import is slow

- CUDA is strongly preferred for SAM3D.
- On systems without CUDA, SAM3D may fall back to CPU.
- BiRefNet can use XPU when available, which can be much faster than CPU for the mask stage.

### SAM3D model download fails

- Manually download from `https://huggingface.co/jetjodh/sam-3d-body-dinov3`.
- Place files under `<ComfyUI>/models/sam3dbody/`.
- Required files are `model.ckpt`, `model_config.yaml`, and `assets/mhr_model.pt`.

### No person is detected from `pose_image`

- Use a clearer full-body source image.
- Avoid heavy occlusion.
- If using the standalone SAM3D process node, provide a `MASK` to guide bbox extraction.

### Pose Library sync leaves unexpected results

- Refresh the repository.
- Check whether the remote manifest includes SHA256 hashes for JSON and previews.
- Check ComfyUI console errors for failed downloads, SHA mismatches, or file-size limits.

### Output image is 1x1 or blank

- For Pose Studio, check that a pose capture exists or that the frontend sync succeeded.
- For BBox Extractor, a 1x1 black output means no valid bbox region was detected.
- For SAM3D render paths, check that `pose_json` is valid and not `{}`.
