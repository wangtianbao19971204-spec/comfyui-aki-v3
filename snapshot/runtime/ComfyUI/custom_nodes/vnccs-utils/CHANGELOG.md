# Version 0.5.3
## Z-Image Fun ControlNet Crash Mitigation

### Fixes

*   **Z-Image masked generation stability**: Moved Fun ControlNet patch loading earlier in the UniCanvas draw pipeline for z-image inpaint/outpaint.
    *   The patch is now loaded before prompt encoding, VAE preload, source-latent encoding, and batch expansion, reducing peak memory pressure at the start of sampling.
    *   The direct Fun ControlNet path still avoids global patch caching, preserving the model asset cloning and memory-safety behavior introduced in `0.5.2`.
    *   A compatibility fallback remains for cases where the preloaded patch is unavailable, with an explicit debug log entry.

### Improvements

*   **Z-Image memory cleanup**: Added the preloaded Fun ControlNet patch object to UniCanvas sampling-reference cleanup.
    *   Empty masked-mode requests that are converted to `img2img` now release the preloaded patch immediately and clear available CUDA cache.
    *   This keeps the `0.5.2` source-latent, VAE preload/unload, batch generation, and smaller tiled decode fixes intact while avoiding a late high-memory patch allocation that could crash ComfyUI on Windows.

# Version 0.5.2
## UniCanvas Batch Generation, Z-Image Latent Flow, and VAE Memory Handling

### New Features

*   **UniCanvas batch generation**: Added a batch-size control next to the Generate button.
    *   Batch size is persisted in UniCanvas settings and clamped to the supported `1-99` range.
    *   Empty latents for SDXL, Anima, Flux Klein, Qwen Image Edit, and Z-Image now respect the selected batch size.
    *   Source latents, `noise_mask`, reference latents, concat masks, and other conditioning metadata are repeated for batch generation when needed.
    *   Draw responses can now return multiple generated images, and the frontend stages every returned image as a separate candidate.
    *   Generation status now displays the batch multiplier during active draws.

### Improvements

*   **Z-Image Fun ControlNet latent source**: In z-image inpaint/outpaint, Fun ControlNet now starts from the current VAE-encoded source latent instead of an empty SD3 latent.
    *   The encoded latent keeps the denoise mask attached, improving masked workflows that should remain anchored to the current canvas content.
    *   Fun ControlNet image, mask, and VAE patch inputs remain in place for structure guidance.

*   **Z-Image VAE handling**: Improved direct z-image masked generation memory behavior.
    *   Preloads the VAE before z-image masked sampling when ComfyUI exposes the needed model-management hook.
    *   Releases sampling-only references before decode to reduce retained tensors.
    *   Unloads the directly used VAE after decode and clears available CUDA cache.
    *   Uses smaller tiled VAE decode tiles for z-image modes to reduce peak memory.

*   **Model asset cloning safety**: Z-Image now uses the shared model/CLIP clone helper before applying runtime patches.
    *   Cached model patches now return clones when possible.
    *   Fun ControlNet patch loading avoids keeping the patch object cached in the direct inpaint/outpaint path.

# Version 0.5.1
## UniCanvas Layout, Model Selection, and Interaction Fixes

### Improvements

*   **UniCanvas responsive layout stabilization**: Reworked UniCanvas UI scaling so the widget keeps consistent proportions across node resize and canvas zoom.
    *   Added layout diagnostics for measuring panel, stage, toolbar, and control proportions during resize.
    *   Added a square default node size for new UniCanvas nodes.
    *   Improved initial fit behavior so the generation bbox is centered after the DOM stage has real dimensions.
    *   Fit now accounts for the floating tool palette so the generation square does not sit underneath the tools.

*   **UniCanvas dropdown usability**: Replaced unreliable native select popups with a controlled DOM dropdown for UniCanvas selectors.
    *   Dropdowns now use the widget's dark styling, readable font sizing, active selection highlighting, and viewport-aware positioning.
    *   Long option values are no longer clipped to the select field width.
    *   Re-clicking the active selector closes the dropdown.

*   **ComfyUI canvas navigation passthrough**: Added PoseStudio-style wheel and middle-mouse forwarding from empty UniCanvas DOM areas to the main ComfyUI graph canvas.
    *   Background wheel/trackpad gestures can zoom/pan the ComfyUI canvas through the widget.
    *   Interactive controls, scrollable panels, the drawing canvas, tool palette, modals, and dropdown menus keep their own input handling.

### Fixes

*   **Custom model selection detection**: Fixed model auto-detection so Qwen/GGUF custom selections are not incorrectly overridden by WAN/Anima matches.
*   **Flux Klein VAE default**: Updated the Flux Klein preset/default VAE selection to use `flux2-vae.safetensors`.
*   **Fit button behavior**: Restored the Fit button to use the full fit-view path.

# Version 0.5.0
## VNCCS UniCanvas Initial Release and Model Workflow Updates

### New Features

*   **VNCCS UniCanvas**: Added the first public release of the integrated canvas workflow for layer-based generation, editing, masking, and object-focused image work directly inside ComfyUI.
    *   Supports prompt-driven generation, inpaint/outpaint workflows, mask editing, object selection, layer compositing, undo/redo, snapping, resizing, and draw progress feedback.
    *   Includes model presets and custom model selection for SDXL/Illustrious, Anima, Flux Klein, Z-Image, and Qwen Image Edit 2511 workflows.
    *   Adds Turbo LoRA support, LoRA Stack controls, sampler/scheduler controls, and automatic model asset download for bundled presets.
    *   Includes SAM-based object mask tooling with first-use model download.

### Improvements

*   **UniCanvas model workflow support**: Added dedicated handling for Anima, Anima LLLite inpainting, Z-Image Fun ControlNet, Flux Klein edit/outpaint, and Qwen Image Edit 2511 reference-latent workflows.
*   **Configuration and asset management**: Added local UniCanvas preset configuration and cleaned up obsolete workflow/config files used during development.
*   **Project maintenance**: Added safer private JSON writes for user configuration paths used by the Pose Library and Model Manager.

# Version 0.4.29
## Pose Studio Live Morph Performance and Pose Manager Stability

### Improvements

*   **Pose Studio live morphing moved to the browser**: Added a dedicated browser-side morph data pipeline for realtime body-parameter previews.
    *   MakeHuman base vertices, morph targets, joint data, and skeleton metadata are exposed through a compact binary endpoint for the live worker.
    *   Age, Gender, Weight, Muscle, Height, breast, firmness, and genital morph parameters can now update the visible mesh without a full Python preview rebuild on every slider input.
    *   A shared morph worker is reused across Pose Studio widgets so multiple active nodes do not each create their own heavy morph worker and duplicate morph-data downloads.
    *   Worker messages are routed by client id so concurrent Pose Studio widgets receive only their own live morph results.

*   **Pose Manager realtime preview updates**: Reworked manager-mode body-slider updates so all pose cards refresh during live morph changes.
    *   Pose Manager now updates every visible pose preview during realtime Age/Weight/Muscle/Height edits instead of waiting for a final Python sync.
    *   Preview refresh work is chunked across animation frames to keep the UI responsive while multiple cards are being recaptured.
    *   Stale worker results are ignored by sequence id so quick slider movement cannot apply older mesh states over newer ones.

*   **Non-blocking Pose Studio startup load**: Reworked the MakeHuman preload path used by the preview API to cooperate with ComfyUI's async server loop.
    *   Startup model loading still happens when the Pose Studio widget opens, but OBJ and target-file reads now yield between chunks instead of monopolizing the server handler.
    *   Preview payload building runs off the aiohttp request path after the shared Pose Studio data cache is loaded.
    *   Cache loading remains serialized so parallel widget startup does not create partially initialized shared MakeHuman state.

### Fixes

*   **Age and Height live skinning**: Fixed live Age/Height morph updates that could temporarily detach the mesh from the skeleton while dragging.
    *   Live morph results now include updated bone/joint positions so the frontend can keep skinned geometry aligned during realtime body-size changes.
    *   The final Python sync remains available for full authoritative mesh rebuilds after dragging, without hammering the server on every input event.

*   **Pose Manager card flicker**: Reduced manager-card flicker after final body-scale recalculation.
    *   Pose cards preserve measured preview dimensions while captures are refreshed.
    *   Capture replacement updates existing card images instead of forcing avoidable full-grid layout churn.
    *   Deleted/reordered poses keep their card metrics aligned with the correct pose index during subsequent live morph refreshes.

*   **Pose Manager lighting restore**: Fixed Pose Manager reloads that could show black/unlit model previews until any parameter was changed.
    *   Lighting is now applied when model data is loaded so restored cards match the configured light state immediately.

*   **Preview API cleanup**: Removed obsolete unreachable preview-generation code left behind during the live morph refactor.
    *   Removed the rejected subprocess preload experiment and all related helper code.
    *   Removed the remaining synchronous data-load fallback from the new preview payload path.

# Version 0.4.28
## Security Hardening, Pose Studio Fixes, and XPU BiRefNet

### Improvements

*   **Pose Studio API and capture hardening**: Added request-size limits, safe ID normalization, and payload validation around preview updates, pose capture cache uploads, SAM3D pose import, mesh-overlay generation, and synchronized pose captures.
    *   Capture uploads are limited by image count and total payload size before entering the cache.
    *   SAM3D image imports now reject oversized uploads and excessive pixel counts before decoding into tensors.
    *   Server-side captured image decoding now validates list shape, per-image size, total payload size, and image dimensions before tensor conversion.

*   **Pose Library safety pass**: Hardened pose repository and local pose save flows.
    *   Added request-size limits to repository management, repository refresh, local pose save, and sync-capture upload endpoints.
    *   Added SHA256 verification for downloaded repository files.
    *   Added per-file and total sync download limits for pose repositories.
    *   Local pose saves now write JSON and preview files through temporary files before replacing the final files.
    *   User config files are saved with restricted file permissions where supported.

*   **Model Manager download hardening**: Tightened model manifest download/install behavior.
    *   Model `local_path` values are now constrained to the ComfyUI `models/` directory.
    *   Direct model download URLs must be HTTPS and cannot resolve to local/private hosts.
    *   Downloads now use request timeouts, a safety size cap, unique temporary files, and cleanup for failed partial downloads.
    *   Model Selector now rejects unsafe manifest paths instead of returning them.

*   **BiRefNet XPU support**: BiRefNet mask loading now selects `xpu` when CUDA is unavailable and `torch.xpu.is_available()` returns true, falling back to CPU otherwise.

*   **SAM3D preset-pack fallback**: Added local preset-pack path helpers for the vendored SAM3D bridge so optional blendshape preset assets can be absent without breaking imports.

*   **Pose Studio ComfyUI navigation passthrough**: Added cautious middle-mouse drag and wheel forwarding from non-interactive Pose Studio background areas to the main ComfyUI canvas.
    *   The passthrough intentionally skips controls, sliders, inputs, tabs, scroll containers, the 3D viewer, camera/light radars, hand popovers, manager grids, and library/modals so existing node interactions keep priority.

### Fixes

*   **Pose Studio camera radar coordinates**: Fixed camera/light radar pointer mapping under ComfyUI node zoom and Pose Studio UI scaling.
    *   Pointer handling now uses a shared canvas-coordinate helper based on `clientX/clientY` plus `getBoundingClientRect()`.
    *   Dragging now uses pointer capture, improving behavior when dragging outside the radar canvas.
    *   Added an opt-in debug log via `window.VNCCS_POSE_RADAR_DEBUG = true` for future coordinate edge-case reports.

*   **Pose Manager input behavior**: `pose_image` is now hidden and disconnected while Pose Studio is in Pose Manager mode.
    *   The backend also ignores `pose_image` when serialized `pose_data` indicates Manager mode, preventing unintended SAM3D pose import execution.

*   **Pose Studio cache initialization**: Protected MakeHuman mesh/target/skeleton loading with a cache lock and atomic cache update to avoid partially initialized shared state.

*   **VNCCS Position Control trigger toggle**: Fixed `include_trigger` so `<sks>` is only emitted when the option is enabled.

# Version 0.4.25
## Pose Studio: Pose Manager Grid and Hand Control Options

### New Features

*   **Hand control mode toggle**: Added a Settings option to enable or disable the newer floating hand-control interface introduced in `0.4.18`.
    *   When disabled, hand editing returns to the pre-`0.4.18` direct-joint workflow with individual finger joints visible and selectable.
    *   The option is persisted in `pose_data` so workflows reopen with the selected hand-control behavior.

*   **Foot Size proportion control**: Added a `Foot Size` slider to Mesh Proportions.
    *   Scales both feet live in the Pose Studio viewer.
    *   Persists with the other mesh proportion settings.

### Improvements

*   **Pose Manager preview grid**: Reworked Pose Manager card layout using the same adaptive image-grid strategy as `VNCCS Character Generator`.
    *   Preview images are measured by their real dimensions before layout.
    *   The grid now chooses rows, columns, and cell sizes to maximize usable preview area across different pose counts and output aspect ratios.
    *   Pose cards stay centered and scale more consistently in wide, tall, compact, and sparse layouts.

*   **Settings toggle visibility**: Improved active-state styling for segmented controls in Settings so the selected option remains clearly visible against the dark background.

# Version 0.4.24
## Pose Studio: Pose Manager, Age Camera Fit, and Character Creator Sync

### New Features

*   **Pose Manager interface**: Added a dedicated Pose Manager mode for managing multi-pose projects from a card/grid view.
    *   Pose cards show per-pose previews and provide faster switching, adding, and deleting poses.
    *   Added a detail-strip workflow for editing a pose while keeping the rest of the pose set visible.
    *   Added manager-side mesh and export controls so common body and output settings can be adjusted without returning to the full Studio layout.

*   **External CharacterCreatorV2 synchronization**: Pose Studio can now detect and sync age/gender values from a `CharacterCreatorV2` node in the graph.
    *   Supports both serialized `widget_data` and ordinary `age`/`sex`/`gender` widgets.
    *   Registers and unregisters Pose Studio widgets as nodes are created, loaded, configured, or removed.
    *   Applies initial values without forcing unnecessary capture updates.

*   **Age camera fit**: Changing Age can now trigger an automatic camera refit so the mannequin remains framed after body-size changes.
    *   Added model-fit zoom computation in the Pose Studio core.
    *   Mesh parameter updates now queue and coalesce more safely before applying the age refit.

### Improvements

*   **Pose Manager layout refinement**: Improved card dimensions, sidebar layout, detail strip behavior, and responsive scaling for compact and large nodes.
*   **Capture performance in manager mode**: Lightweight syncs from manager controls can skip unnecessary preview captures, reducing UI lag while editing values.
*   **State persistence**: Pose Studio now persists the selected interface mode in `pose_data` so workflows can reopen into the expected Studio or Manager view.

# Version 0.4.23
## Security Cleanup and Compatibility Hardening

### Fixes

*   **Security-sensitive request cleanup**: 
*   **Token handling cleanup**: 
*   **Debug flag cleanup**:
*   **Frontend security compatibility**: 

# Version 0.4.22
## SAM3D Dependency Cleanup and Installation Docs

### Improvements

*   **SAM3D dependency cleanup**: Removed optional SciPy/tqdm-style dependency usage from SAM 3D Body processing paths.
    *   Face blend-shape region matching now uses the built-in NumPy fallback path directly.
    *   SAM3D download progress now uses the lightweight internal progress wrapper without importing `tqdm`.
    *   DINOv3 hub exports were reduced to the backbone imports used by this extension.

*   **Installation guide refresh**: Updated README installation instructions with the recommended ComfyUI Manager flow plus manual `git clone` and `pip install -r requirements.txt` steps.

# Version 0.4.21
## Dependency Cleanup and Pose Library Packaging

### Improvements

*   **Removed `braceexpand` dependency**: Replaced the external package with an internal brace expansion helper for SAM 3D Body URL/path expansion.
    *   Supports comma options and numeric ranges, including padded ranges and nested expansion.
    *   Keeps SAM3D URL expansion working while reducing install friction.

*   **Dependency list cleanup**: Removed `braceexpand` from both `pyproject.toml` and `requirements.txt`.
*   **Package cleanup**: Removed bundled local user pose files from `PoseLibrary/local_user_poses` so personal/generated pose data is not shipped with the extension package.

# Version 0.4.20
## Model Manager Width Sync and Workflow Refresh

### Fixes

*   **Model Manager DOM width sync**: Added width synchronization for the `ModelList` DOM widget so it follows node resizing and workflow restore correctly.
    *   Handles node creation, resize, and configure flows.
    *   Prevents stale restored DOM widget widths from breaking the Model Manager layout.

*   **Model Selector DOM width sync**: Added the same width binding for the `SelectorWidget`, improving model selector card sizing after resize or graph load.
*   **Pose Studio workflow refresh**: Updated the bundled Klein9b Pose Studio workflow metadata/layout for the current node setup.

# Version 0.4.19
## Pose Studio: SAM 3D Body Import, Proportion Controls, and Showcase Refresh

### New Features

*   **Pose Image input for Pose Studio**: Added an optional `pose_image` input to the `VNCCS_PoseStudio` node.
    *   When an image is connected, Pose Studio can run the SAM 3D Body pipeline and use the detected body pose as the source for the active Pose Studio rig.
    *   The backend sends the detected SAM pose to the frontend and waits for the widget to apply and sync the resulting Pose Studio state before execution continues.
    *   Pose image changes now participate in `IS_CHANGED`, so ComfyUI correctly re-executes when the connected pose reference image changes.

*   **SAM 3D Body pose import and retargeting**: Expanded Pose Studio's import pipeline to handle SAM3D-style body data.
    *   Added SAM keypoint, joint, face, hand, foot, and dense MHR joint mapping into the Pose Studio core.
    *   Added conversion from SAM3D body data into MakeHuman/Pose Studio bone targets.
    *   Added IK-based fitting for pelvis, torso, arms, legs, head, hands, and feet using imported SAM targets.
    *   Added support for SAM3D JSON/image import from the Pose Studio UI path.

*   **SAM debug and fitting tools**: Added dedicated controls for inspecting and tuning SAM imports.
    *   **Show SAM Helper Skeleton** displays the imported SAM3D reference skeleton in the viewport for alignment debugging.
    *   **Show SAM Render Mesh Overlay** displays the postprocessed SAM3D body render mesh as a translucent overlay against the Pose Studio mannequin.
    *   SAM helper overlays are hidden during final capture so they do not leak into output images.

*   **SAM-aware camera matching**: Added camera fitting logic for imported SAM poses.
    *   Pose Studio can compute framing from SAM3D projection data, render-frame bounds, projected vertices, or fallback bbox data.
    *   Added `cam_yaw_deg` and `cam_pitch_deg` capture parameters so imported camera angles can be represented in Pose Studio state.
    *   Added **SAM Import: Apply Camera Angle** setting to either match the detected SAM camera angle or keep the user's current camera view and compensate via model rotation.

*   **Detailed body proportion controls**: Expanded the mesh/proportion system beyond the previous broad arm/hand controls.
    *   Added per-side upper arm length controls.
    *   Added per-side forearm length controls.
    *   Added per-side thigh length controls.
    *   Added per-side shin length controls.
    *   Added spine length control.
    *   Preserved compatibility with older saved data that used broader `arm_length`, `upper_arm_length`, `forearm_length`, `leg_length`, `thigh_length`, or `shin_length` fields.

### Improvements

*   **Capture and sync reliability**: Pose Studio now stores only a lightweight `capture_id` in widget state while captured images are kept in memory and uploaded to the server-side capture cache.
    *   This keeps workflow JSON lighter while still allowing the Python backend to recover captured images from the LRU cache during execution.
    *   Full-capture mode now carries yaw/pitch camera parameters through pose capture, preview, and queue-time output.

*   **Keep Original Lighting behavior**: The updated capture path more consistently respects `keepOriginalLighting`.
    *   Final captures can use clean flat ambient lighting while prompt generation avoids adding synthetic lighting text.
    *   Debug/full-capture paths restore the user's lighting state after temporary capture changes.

*   **Pose Studio example workflow refresh**: Updated the bundled Pose Studio showcase workflow for the new pose-image/SAM import flow.
    *   Added a dedicated pose-reference image input feeding Pose Studio's `pose_image`.
    *   Updated the character image and generation path around the Pose Studio output.
    *   Updated the workflow to newer ComfyUI frontend/core node metadata.

# Version 0.4.18
## Pose Studio: Hand Interaction Pass, Camera Sync Cleanup, and Input Behavior Fixes

### New Features

*   **Contextual Hand Editing UI**: Hand editing was reworked from a permanent sidebar tool into an in-canvas interaction flow.
    *   Hands can now be targeted directly from the model viewport.
    *   The hand editor opens as a floating popover near the active hand instead of occupying the right sidebar.
    *   Built-in hand presets were added in [web/vnccs_hand_presets.js](web/vnccs_hand_presets.js) to drive the hand shaping workflow without requiring an external hand-pose library.

*   **Improved Hand Pose Controls**: The hand slider system was expanded and stabilized.
    *   Added calibrated hand preset blending for `Spread`, `Grasp`, and per-finger controls.
    *   Slider defaults are now derived from the actual current hand pose instead of hardcoded placeholder values, reducing the first-use snap/jump when editing a hand.

### Fixes

*   **Camera Preview / Capture Sync Cleanup**:
    *   Refactored Pose Studio camera handling for clearer internal state flow.
    *   Updated preview snapping logic to use `snapToCaptureCamera`, improving consistency between viewport framing and capture framing.

*   **Direct Limb Dragging Stability**:
    *   Added more explicit direct-drag state tracking for bone interactions.
    *   Improved click-versus-drag handling around IK/direct manipulation so interaction state is more predictable.

*   **Hand Popover Input Behavior**:
    *   Added dedicated pointer-event handling for the floating hand popover.
    *   Outside-click closing behavior is now safer and better isolated from other pointer interactions in the Pose Studio viewport.

# Version 0.4.17
## Pose Studio: Sakura Design System and Sync Tabs

### New Features

*   **Arm Size and Hand Size sliders**: Two new sliders in the Character Mesh section (below Head Size).
    *   `Arm Size` — scales the `upperarm_l` / `upperarm_r` bones, affecting the full arm length and thickness.
    *   `Hand Size` — scales the `hand_l` / `hand_r` bones independently from arm size.
    *   Both work client-side (no server roundtrip), persist in the workflow, and are re-applied automatically after mesh rebuilds (age/weight/etc. changes).

*   **Sakura Design System**: Redesigned the entire Pose Studio node UI with the Sakura Archive premium dark-anime aesthetic.
    *   All CSS variables are now scoped to `.vnccs-pose-studio` instead of `:root` — no style leakage to other ComfyUI tabs or extensions.
    *   Deep dark backgrounds (`#0a0a0f`) with glassmorphic panels and translucent surfaces.
    *   Sakura pink (`#ff8fa3`) accent with glow effects replacing the previous blue accent.
    *   Section headers feature a luminous top highlight gradient and a left accent bar.
    *   Slider thumbs have a sakura glow, primary buttons include a shimmer animation.
    *   Canvas area uses a subtle sakura dot-grid background.
    *   Loading spinner upgraded to a dual-ring sakura/lavender design.
    *   Typography updated to Sora (UI) and JetBrains Mono (values/numbers).

*   **Sync Zoom to All Tabs**: New button in the Camera section that appears only when more than one pose tab is active.
    *   Sets the current Zoom level to all tabs simultaneously.
    *   Automatically re-renders previews for all tabs after syncing.

# Version 0.4.16
## Pose Studio: OpenPose Import and Workflow Size Fix

### New Features

*   **OpenPose Import**: Import `.json` and image files (`.png`, `.jpg`, `.webp`) directly into the Pose Studio to import poses from OpenPose-compatible sources.
    *   Supports both OpenPose JSON format (body, hand, face keypoints) and OpenPose-rendered images via keypoint extraction.
    *   Converts OpenPose skeleton to MakeHuman bone rotations automatically.
    *   Includes a round-trip angle validation test to verify conversion accuracy.
    * STILL WIP, CAN BE BUGS, BROKEN JOINTS, OR JUST WRONG RESULTS. For now it works only with full body poses without heavy body rotations.

### Fixes

*   **Fix: "Failed to save workflow draft" with many active tabs**: Captured images (base64 PNG, ~500 KB each at 1024×1024) were being serialized into the `pose_data` widget on every sync. With many tabs this exceeded ComfyUI's workflow draft size limit. Captured images are now uploaded to a server-side LRU cache (`/vnccs/pose_captures_upload`) keyed by node ID — the widget stores only a lightweight `capture_id` string. The cache holds up to 10 entries with automatic eviction.

# Version 0.4.15
## Fixes: Pose Studio Tab State and Workflow Size

*   **Fix: Frame zoom and position lost on tab switch**: When adjusting the capture frame (zoom/offset) without moving any bones, the viewer's internal `cameraParams` remained stale. On tab switch, `getPose()` saved these stale params, so returning to the tab restored the wrong frame. Fixed by always reading `exportParams` (the authoritative widget state) as the source of truth when saving a pose — in `switchTab`, `addTab`, and `syncToNode`.

*   **Fix: Copy/Paste ignoring frame settings**: `copyPose` saved the pose using the potentially stale viewer-internal `cameraParams`, and `pastePose` did not restore frame zoom/offset to the widget or viewport. Both are now fixed: copy captures current `exportParams`, paste restores zoom/offset sliders and calls `snapToCaptureCamera`.

*   **Fix: "Failed to save workflow draft" with 4+ poses**: Captured images (base64 PNG, ~500 KB each at 1024×1024) were being serialized into the `pose_data` widget on every sync, quickly exceeding ComfyUI's localStorage limit. Captured images are now kept only in JS memory (`poseCaptures`) and injected directly into the execution upload payload at queue time — the widget no longer stores them.

*   **Fix: All poses captured with wrong frame on queue**: During full capture (`syncToNode(true)`), every pose was rendered using the global `exportParams.cam_zoom/offset` (the active tab's settings) instead of each pose's own saved `cameraParams`. Each pose is now captured with its own frame zoom and offset.

# Version 0.4.14
## Fix: Root Bone Drift on Age Change
*   **Fix: Model floating above root bone**: When changing the AGE parameter, the mesh would shrink but the root bone stayed at the old position, causing the model to appear floating. This was caused by stale absolute IK positions (`hipBonePosition`, `ikEffectorPositions`, `poleTargetPositions`) being restored from saved pose data after skeleton rebuild. Now all saved poses are stripped of absolute position data before re-applying after a mesh parameter change.

# Version 0.4.13
## Architecture: Pose Studio Core Extraction
*   **Decoupled Viewer Logic**: Extracted the core Three.js 3D viewer, IK solvers, and rendering logic from the ComfyUI widget into a standalone, UI-agnostic module (`vnccs_pose_studio_core.js`).
*   **External UI Integration**: Established a strict, configurable public API for the new core module, enabling secure embedding and full pose control in external applications without relying on internal variable hacks or ComfyUI dependencies.
*   **Strict API Contract**: Refactored the internal ComfyUI Node shell (`vnccs_pose_studio.js`) to exclusively consume the new core module via its public API getters/setters (e.g., `setSkinMode`, `setCameraParams`, `isInitialized`), completely isolating the internal rendering state from the UI application.

# Version 0.4.11
## Improvements: True Screen-Space Limb Dragging (IK)
*   **Intuitive IK Control**: Completely overhauled the IK interaction model. You can now grab and drag limbs directly in screen-space without gizmos or modifier keys. The limb smoothly follows the mouse cursor.
*   **FK/IK Seamless Switching**: Clicking without dragging instantly brings up the standard rotation rings (FK mode) for fine-tuning.
*   **Unified IK Logic**: Consolidated disparate effector update methods into a single parameterized handler and extracted complex pole-target math into a reusable helper.
*   *Credit*: This elegant interaction system was proposed and conceptualized by [DanzeluS Github](https://github.com/neurodanzelus-cmd) / [DanzeluS Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/user/DanzeluS/).

# Version 0.4.10
## Fixes: MIME Types and Layout Reliability
*   **Fix: MIME Type Errors**: 
    *   Moved Three.js modules to the `web` root directory.
    *   This ensures the ComfyUI server correctly identifies them as `application/javascript`, resolving "disallowed MIME type" blocking in Firefox.
*   **UI: Final Radar Scaling**:
    *   Further reduced the **Positioning Menu** (Camera Radar) size to `140px`.
    *   This prevents overflow in the 220px sidebar even when vertical scrollbars are visible.

# Version 0.4.9
## Fixes: CSP Security and Desktop Compatibility
*   **Security: Three.js Vendoring**:
    *   Resolved ComfyUI Content Security Policy (CSP) errors by vendoring Three.js and its extensions (`OrbitControls`, `TransformControls`) locally.
    *   Removed external CDN dependencies (`esm.sh`), ensuring the extension works in offline and restricted environments.
*   **Fix: Desktop Coordinate Offset**:
    *   Fixed a critical issue in ComfyUI Desktop where control points were shifted relative to the mouse.
    *   Removed non-standard CSS `zoom` and replaced it with a 1:1 coordinate mapping system.
*   **UI: Compactness Refinement**:
    *   Manually optimized the entire UI layout for space efficiency.
    *   Reduced font sizes, sidebars (now symmetrical at 220px), and internal component paddings.
    *   Refined the **Lighting Radar** and mannequin **Positioning Menu** to fit perfectly within the new narrow layout.

# Version 0.4.7
## Fixes: Workflow Loading and Model Updates
*   **Critical Fix: Workflow Crash**: Resolved a `TypeError: Attempting to change configurable attribute of unconfigurable property` that occurred when loading workflows. This was caused by a conflict with ComfyUI's internal widget serialization.
*   **Model Manager: Manual Refresh**:
    *   The "**Check/Refresh Models**" button now correctly bypasses the server-side 60-minute cache, allowing for instant discovery of new model updates on Hugging Face.
    *   Added immediate visual feedback (Loading state) when a manual refresh is triggered.

# Version 0.4.5
## Fixes & Improvements: Node 2.0 Stability and Rendering Quality
*   **Rendering: Body Contours**:
    *   Implemented a **Rim Darkening (Fresnel) Shader** for the character mannequin. This darkens the edges of the mesh based on view-space normals, ensuring body details like muscle definition and limb separation are visible even in flat white/ambient lighting modes.
*   **Defaults: Character Type**:
    *   Changed default skin type from "Dummy White" to "**Naked**".
*   **Fixes: Node 2.0 Compatibility**:
    *   Resolved an infinite node resize loop caused by layout feedback in ComfyUI's new node2.0 (Vue) frontend.
    *   Implemented robust hiding for the `pose_data` widget compatible with both legacy LiteGraph and node2.0 modes.
    *   Fixed a `TypeError` related to `serializeValue` redefinition when initializing the node.
*   **Fixes: Lighting UI Persistence**:
    *   The "**Keep Original Lighting**" button now correctly restores its visual state (toggle status and color) after a page reload.

# Version 0.4.4
## Fixes & Improvements: Smart Updates and Control Stability
*   **Model Manager: Smart HF Updates**:
    *   Implemented a throttled update strategy (60-minute cycle) to prevent Hugging Face rate limiting (429 errors).
    *   Added **Hugging Face Token** support in the new Settings menu (⚙️) to significantly increase API rate limits.
    *   Added automatic 10-minute back-off logic when rate limiting is detected.
*   **Pose Studio: Improved Bone Selection**:
    *   Rewrote the selection logic to use marker-based raycasting. Joint markers (yellow dots) are now prioritized over the character mesh, making them much easier to select from any angle, especially from the front.
*   **Interface: Control Stabilizers**:
    *   Migrated Visual Camera and Light Radar controls to **Pointer Capture**. This prevents controls from getting "stuck" or "jumping" when the mouse moves outside the node area during a drag.
    *   Fixed a bug where the camera would jump to "Wide" distance ring when the cursor left the node boundaries; it now locks distance correctly based on proximity.
*   **Settings: Skin Texture Selector**:
    *   Added a new "Skin" selector in the Settings menu (⚙️). Toggle between **Dummy White**, **Naked**, and **Marked** textures instantly without rebuilding the mesh. Selection is persisted between sessions.
*   **Lights: Default Type**:
    *   Changed the default light type from "Point" to "**Directional**" when adding new light sources.
*   **Fixes: Background Image**:
    *   Fixed background image appearing as a grey area upon initial load; it now renders immediately without requiring camera movement.
    *   Restored "Real Colors" for the background image by increasing opacity to 100% and correctly applying the sRGB color space.
    *   **Background Persistence**: The background image is now saved within the node state and automatically restored between sessions.
    *   **Auto-Preview**: Loading a background image now automatically triggers a model preview update to fix the camera frame and alignment.
*   **Fixes: Node Resize Loop (node2.0)**: Fixed infinite node stretching on systems using ComfyUI's node2.0 mode, caused by a feedback loop between canvas sizing and layout measurement.

# Version 0.4.2
## Fixes: Pose Studio Layout Stability
*   **Eliminated Resize Loop**: Refactored the `onResize` handler to stop modifying container dimensions manually. The layout now fills the node naturally, preventing infinite growth and fluctuations while remaining perfectly synced with the Three.js viewport.
*   **Performance (Resize Debouncing)**: Implemented debouncing for layout updates. The interface no longer flickers when resizing the node or moving the ComfyUI board.
*   **Cleaned Event Handling**: Removed redundant `setTimeout` chains that were repeatedly re-triggering size calculations.
*   **Dynamic Resource Loading**: Replaced hardcoded `/extensions/ComfyUI_VNCCS_Utils/` paths with dynamic URL detection. This fixes 404 errors for users where the plugin directory is named differently (e.g., `vnccs-utils` when installed via ComfyUI Manager).
*   **Firefox Compatibility**: Resolved multiple issues with the vertical light height (Y-HGT) slider in Firefox:
    *   Added required `orient="vertical"` attribute.
    *   Updated CSS with `writing-mode: vertical-lr` for correct vertical orientation.
    *   Applied `direction: rtl` to fix the inverted value direction (ensuring Min is at the bottom).

# Version 0.4.1
## Fixes & Optimizations: VNCCS Pose Studio
*   **Performance (Lazy Loading)**: The Pose Library now loads significantly faster. Full pose data is fetched only when needed (e.g., for randomization), while the gallery displays lightweight metadata.
*   **Memory Leak Fix (Three.js)**: Fixed a memory leak involving joint markers. Geometries and materials are now properly shared and disposed of, preventing gradual performance degradation.
*   **Input Offset (High-DPI Screens)**: Resolved an issue where mouse clicks were offset on 4K monitors with system scaling enabled. Replaced non-standard `zoom` CSS with `transform: scale()`.
*   **UI Lag Fix**: Debounced the data sync mechanism during slider and radar interactions. Dragging controls is now buttery smooth (60fps) while maintaining data integrity.
*   **Auto-Healing Backend**: The node now automatically detects if the 3D engine is uninitialized (e.g., after a server restart) and reloads the model before processing requests, preventing "stale cache" errors.
*   **Grid Mode Output**: Fixed `OUTPUT_IS_LIST` behavior for Grid Mode. It now correctly returns a list containing a single grid image tensor, resolving compatibility with preview nodes.
*   **Clean Prompts (Grid Mode)**: Grid Mode now generates a single, clean prompt (based on the first pose) instead of concatenating prompts from all grid cells.

## Improvements: Model Manager
*   **Smart Throttling**: Implemented a 5-minute local cache for `model_updater.json` checks. This eliminates excessive HEAD requests to Hugging Face during frequent workflow executions.
*   **Dependencies**: Added `requests` (was missing) and removed `color-matcher` (unused).

## New Features: Pose Studio Refinements
*   **Keep Original Lighting Mode**: New toggle to skip synthetic lighting in the 3D viewer, providing a clean white render while suppressing AI lighting prompts.
*   **Dynamic Prompt Overrides**: When "Keep Original Lighting" is ON, instructions like "Copy how the lighting falls..." are automatically replaced with "**Keep original lighting and colors.**"
*   **Debug Mode Enhancements**: 
    *   **Keep Manual Lighting**: Option to preserve custom lighting during randomized debug renders.
    *   **Accurate Portrait Mode**: Refined camera math for consistent upper-body framing in synthetic datasets.
*   **Natural Language Descriptions**: Refactored lighting prompts to be more descriptive (e.g., "character illuminated by...") for better SDXL/FLUX integration.

## Stability & Performance
*   **Initialization Fix**: Added a robust lighting failsafe to prevent the "black silhouette" bug on node load.
*   **UI Resizing**: Fixed a precision issue in aspect ratio calculation that caused vertical/horizontal stretching of the viewport.
*   **Library Stability**: Fixed a crash in the Pose Library grid when attempting to refresh without an open modal.
*   **Skeleton Sync**: Corrected handling of retargeted vertex weights for Game Engine configurations.

# Version 0.4.0
## New Features: VNCCS Pose Studio
The **VNCCS Pose Studio** is a major addition to the utility suite, offering a fully interactive 3D character posing environment directly inside ComfyUI.
*   **Interactive 3D Viewport**: Real-time WebGL-based bone manipulation (FK) with gizmo controls.
*   **Customizable Mannequin**: Parametric body sliders (Age, Gender, Weight, Muscle, Height, etc.) to match your character's physique.
*   **Pose Library**: Built-in system to **Save**, **Load**, and **Delete** your custom poses. Includes a starter set of poses (T-Pose, etc.).
*   **Multi-Pose Tabs**: Create and manage multiple poses in a single node instance. Generates batch image outputs for consistent character workflows.
*   **Camera Control**: Fine-tune framing with Zoom and Pan (X/Y) controls. All camera changes sync instantly across all pose tabs.
*   **Reference Image**: Load a background 2D image to trace or reference poses easily.
*   **Smart UI**: 
    *   Collapsible sections for cleaner workspace.
    *   **Reset Buttons (↺)** on all sliders to quickly revert to defaults.
    *   Auto-scaling UI that adapts to node resizing.
    *   Context-sensitive help (Tooltip-like behavior).

## Improvements
*   **Dependencies**: Added `kornia` and `color-matcher` to requirements for broader compatibility with vision tasks.
*   **Stability**: Fixed layout issues with "Delete" modal and button alignment in the web widget.
*   **Performance**: Optimized 3D rendering and texture management for lower VRAM overhead when using the Pose Studio.


# Version 0.3.1
## Changed:
### VNCCS QWEN Detailer
- **Drift Fix Logic**: Completely refactored `distortion_fix`. It now **only** controls square padding/cropping. The previously coupled logic that disabled VL tokens has been removed; the model now *always* sees vision tokens.
- **Color Match Tuning**: Reduced default `color_match_strength` from 1.0 to **0.8** to prevent over-brightening of shadows.
- **Padding Color**: Changed padding fill color from black to **white** (value 1.0) when squaring images.
- **Color Correction Migration**: Switched from `color-matcher` to **Kornia** for faster, GPU-accelerated color transfer.
- **Default Method**:  The default `color_match_method` is now `kornia_reinhard`.
- **Dependencies**: Removed `color-matcher` from requirements. Added `kornia`.

### Fixed
- **Kornia Import**: Fixed possible `ImportError` for `histogram_matching` on older Kornia versions (wrapped in try-except).

### Deprecated / Temporary
- **Legacy Compatibility Layer**: Added a transient frontend/backend fix to support legacy workflows using removed methods (e.g., `mkl`).
    - *Note: This auto-replacement logic (JS auto-fix on load + Backend auto-fix on execution) is temporary and will be removed in a future update. Users are encouraged to save their workflows with the new settings.*
