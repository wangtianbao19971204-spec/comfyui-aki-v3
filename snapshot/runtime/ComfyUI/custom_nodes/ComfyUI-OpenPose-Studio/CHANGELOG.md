# Changelog

## [1.7.0] - 2026-05-07

### Fixed
- Fixed the OpenPose Studio node preview to work correctly with ComfyUI Nodes 2.0, restoring full preview functionality for users on the new node system.
- Preserved backward compatibility so the preview continues to work with classic ComfyUI nodes.
- Fixed direct `Pose JSON` widget edits not refreshing the preview; changes to the widget value now immediately update the displayed pose.
