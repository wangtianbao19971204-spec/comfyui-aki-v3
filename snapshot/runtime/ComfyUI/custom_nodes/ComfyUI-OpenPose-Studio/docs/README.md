# OpenPose Studio for ComfyUI 🤸

OpenPose Studio is an advanced ComfyUI extension for creating, editing, previewing, and organizing OpenPose poses with a streamlined interface. It makes it easy to adjust keypoints visually, save and load pose files, browse pose presets and galleries, manage pose collections, merge multiple poses, and export clean JSON data for use in ControlNet and other pose-driven workflows.

## Installation

### Requirements
- ComfyUI (recent build)
- Python 3.10+

### Steps

1. Clone this repository into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/`.
2. Restart ComfyUI.
3. Confirm nodes appear under `image > OpenPose Studio`.

---

## Usage

### Basic Workflow

1. Add the **OpenPose Studio** node to your workflow
2. Click the node's preview canvas to open the editor UI
3. Select a pose from the presets or gallery to insert into canvas
4. Adjust keypoints by dragging them on the canvas
5. Click **Apply** to render the pose. This will create the serialized JSON in the node.
6. Connect the `image` output to subsequent image nodes
7. Connect the `kps` output to ControlNet/OpenPose compatible nodes

### Editor Preview

![OpenPose Studio UI](../locales/en/openpose-studio.png)

## Nodes

### OpenPose Studio

**Category:** `image`

- **Input:** `Pose JSON` (STRING) — standard OpenPose-style JSON.
- **Optional Inputs:**
  - `areas` (`CONDITIONING_AREAS`) — area overlay data; connect the `areas_out` output of a [Conditioning Pipeline (Combine)](https://github.com/andreszs/comfyui-lora-pipeline) node to visualize conditioning regions on the canvas
  - `pose_keypoint` (`POSE_KEYPOINT`) — detected pose data; connect the output of a **DWPose Estimator** node to load upstream-detected poses directly into the editor
- **Options:**
  - `render body` — include body in the rendered preview/output image
  - `render hands` — include hands in the rendered preview/output image (if present in the JSON)
  - `render face` — include face in the rendered preview/output image (if present in the JSON)
- **Outputs:**
  - `IMAGE` — Rendered pose visualization as RGB image (float32, 0-1 range)
  - `JSON` — OpenPose-style pose JSON with canvas dimensions and people array containing keypoint data
  - `KPS` — Keypoint data in POSE_KEYPOINT format, compatible with ControlNet
- **UI:** Click the node preview to open the interactive editor. Use the **open editor** button (pencil icon) to edit the pose directly.

## Editor Controls & Shortcuts

### Keyboard Shortcuts

| Control | Action |
|---------|--------|
| **Enter** | Apply pose and close editor |
| **Escape** | Cancel and discard changes |
| **Ctrl+Z** | Undo last action |
| **Ctrl+Y** | Redo last undone action |
| **Delete** | Remove selected keypoint |

### Canvas Interactions

- **Click**: Select keypoint
- **Drag**: Move keypoint to new position
- **Scroll**: Zoom in/out on canvas (TO-DO)

### Background Reference

Load reference images (e.g., anatomy guides, photo references) as non-destructive overlays during pose editing. Use **Contain** mode to fit images within the canvas or **Cover** mode to fill the canvas. Adjust opacity as needed.

- **Load Image**: Import reference image from disk
- **Contain/Cover**: Choose scaling mode
- **Opacity**: Adjust transparency (0-100%)

> [!NOTE]
> Background images persist during the ComfyUI session but are **not** saved in workflows.

### Areas Input

The **areas** input is an **optional** connection that overlays conditioning area boundaries on the canvas during pose editing.

Connect the `areas_out` output of the [**Conditioning Pipeline (Combine)**](https://github.com/andreszs/comfyui-lora-pipeline) node from the [ComfyUI-LoRA-Pipeline](https://github.com/andreszs/comfyui-lora-pipeline) repository to visualize which regions each area targets while you position your poses.

![Areas input connection — areas_out from Conditioning Pipeline (Combine) wired to the areas input of OpenPose Studio](../locales/en/openpose-studio-areas-input.png)

Each area is displayed as a labeled badge on the canvas. Click any badge to **enable or disable** that area individually, letting you focus on the regions relevant to your current pose.

![Areas Input](../locales/en/openpose-studio-areas.png)

This combination is particularly useful when building multi-character workflows: [ComfyUI-LoRA-Pipeline](https://github.com/andreszs/comfyui-lora-pipeline) handles the per-area conditioning and LoRA assignment, while OpenPose Studio keeps the pose placement accurate within each region. The result is a straightforward, non-destructive setup where both per-area and per-pose LoRAs can be applied simultaneously without interference. If you are not yet familiar with area-based conditioning, the [ComfyUI-LoRA-Pipeline](https://github.com/andreszs/comfyui-lora-pipeline) extension is designed exactly for this kind of workflow and pairs well with this node.

For a real-world example of all three repos working together — area conditioning, OpenPose control, and style layering — see this [step-by-step workflow guide](https://www.andreszsogon.com/building-a-multi-character-comfyui-workflow-with-area-conditioning-openpose-control-and-style-layering/).

### <a id="pose-keypoint-input"></a>Pose Keypoint Input

The **pose_keypoint** input is an **optional** connection that lets OpenPose Studio consume pose data detected upstream in your workflow.

Connect the output of a **DWPose Estimator** node to this input. The detected keypoints are loaded directly into the editor, where you can inspect, refine, or extend them before rendering.

![Pose keypoint input connection — DWPose Estimator output wired to the pose_keypoint input of OpenPose Studio](../locales/en/openpose-studio-pose_keypoint-input.png)

---

## Format Specifications

This editor fully supports **OpenPose COCO-18 (body)** editing.

It also supports **OpenPose face and hands data** in a *pass-through* manner: if your JSON includes face and/or hand keypoints, they are preserved (not removed) and the Python node can render them correctly. However, **editing face and hand keypoints is not available yet** (planned for upcoming updates).

### OpenPose COCO-18 keypoints (body)

COCO-18 uses **18 body keypoints**. The pose is stored as a flat array named `pose_keypoints_2d` with the pattern:

`[x0, y0, c0, x1, y1, c1, ...]`

Where each keypoint has:
- `x`, `y`: pixel coordinates in the canvas
- `c`: confidence (commonly `0..1`; `0` can be used for “missing” points)

Keypoint order (index → name):

| Index | Name |
|------:|------|
| 0 | Nose |
| 1 | Neck |
| 2 | Right Shoulder |
| 3 | Right Elbow |
| 4 | Right Wrist |
| 5 | Left Shoulder |
| 6 | Left Elbow |
| 7 | Left Wrist |
| 8 | Right Hip |
| 9 | Right Knee |
| 10 | Right Ankle |
| 11 | Left Hip |
| 12 | Left Knee |
| 13 | Left Ankle |
| 14 | Right Eye |
| 15 | Left Eye |
| 16 | Right Ear |
| 17 | Left Ear |

> [!NOTE]
> **COCO** refers to the *Common Objects in Context* keypoint convention/dataset naming widely used in pose estimation. “COCO-18” here means the OpenPose body layout with 18 keypoints.

### Minimal JSON shape

A typical single-pose OpenPose-style JSON includes canvas dimensions and one `people` entry with `pose_keypoints_2d`:

```json
{
  "canvas_width": 512,
  "canvas_height": 512,
  "people": [
    {
      "pose_keypoints_2d": [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0 /* ... 18 * 3 values total ... */]
    }
  ]
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> The editor can handle partial poses (some keypoints missing). Missing points are typically represented as 0,0,0. You can also delete distal keypoints using the Pose Editor.

### JSON format: Standard vs Legacy

- **OpenPose Studio:** reads/writes **standard OpenPose-style JSON** and also accepts older non-standard (legacy) JSON.

Practical notes:
- Pasting standard JSON into the OpenPose Studio node will render preview immediately.

---

## Gallery & Pose Management

### Overview

The **Gallery** tab provides visual browsing of all available poses with live preview thumbnails. It automatically discovers and organizes poses without manual configuration.

![Pose Gallery](../locales/en/openpose-studio-gallery.png)

### View modes

The Gallery supports three display modes:
- **Large** — larger previews for quick visual selection
- **Medium** — balanced preview size and density
- **Tiles** — compact grid with extra metadata (e.g. **canvas size**, **keypoint counts**, and other pose details)

### Features

- **Auto-discovery**: Scans `poses/` directory on startup
- **Nested organization**: Subdirectory names become group labels
- **Live preview**: Thumbnail rendering for each pose
- **Search/filter**: Find poses by name or group
- **One-click load**: Select a pose to load into editor

### Supported File Types

- **Single-pose JSON**: Individual OpenPose JSON files
- **Pose Collections**: Multi-pose JSON files (each pose shown separately)
- **Nested directories**: Poses in subdirectories automatically grouped

### Deterministic Behavior

Gallery ordering and discovery is fully deterministic:
- No random shuffling
- Consistent alphabetical sorting
- Root poses listed first, then grouped poses
- Immediate reload of all JSON poses upon opening the Editor window.

---

## Pose Merger

### Purpose

The **Pose Merger** tab consolidates multiple individual pose JSON files into organized pose collection files. This is useful for:

- Converting large pose libraries into single files
- Cleaning pose data (removing face/hand keypoints)
- Reorganizing and renaming poses
- Distributing pose packs efficiently

### Workflow

1. **Add Files**: Load individual or collection JSON files
2. **Preview**: Each pose shown with thumbnail
3. **Configure**: Optionally exclude face/hand components
4. **Export**: Save as combined collection or individual files

### Key Capabilities

| Feature | Use Case |
|---------|----------|
| **Load Multiple Files** | Bulk import from file system |
| **Component Filtering** | Remove unnecessary face/hand data |
| **Collection Expansion** | Extract poses from existing collections |
| **Batch Renaming** | Assign meaningful names during export |
| **Selective Export** | Choose which poses to include |

### Output Options

- **Combined Collection**: Single JSON with all poses
- **Individual Files**: One file per pose (for compatibility)

Both output formats are automatically picked up by Gallery and Pose Selector.

---

## Render

The **Render** module lets you customize how the OpenPose stickman is rendered when the workflow executes. It includes body, hands, and face styling controls such as line width, keypoint radius, and keypoint color for hands/face.

Render settings are saved locally in this browser's local storage, not in the workflow. Changing them affects subsequent workflow executions.

## Known Limitations

> [!WARNING]
> Nodes 2.0 is currently not supported. Please disable Nodes 2.0 for now.

### Current Limitations & Workarounds

1. **Hand & Face Editing**
  - Issue: Editor currently limited to body keypoints (0-17)
  - Status: Planned for future release
  - Workaround: Use Pose Merger to manually edit hand/face JSON before importing

2. **Resolution Consistency**
  - Issue: Pose Merger doesn't auto-unify resolution across collection exports
  - Status: Needs careful implementation to avoid clipping
  - Workaround: Pre-scale poses to target resolution before importing

3. **Nodes 2.0 Compatibility**
  - Issue: The node does not behave correctly when ComfyUI "Nodes 2.0" is enabled.
  - Status: Planned fix, but it is a large and time-consuming refactor.
  - Note: This project is developed using paid AI agents. Once funding is available to purchase additional AI tokens, I intend to prioritize Nodes 2.0 support.
  - Workaround: Disable Nodes 2.0 for now.

### Error Recovery

The plugin includes defensive error handling:
- Invalid JSON files skip silently in Gallery
- Rendering errors return blank images instead of crashing
- Missing metadata falls back to safe defaults
- Malformed keypoints are filtered during rendering

---

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues & Solutions

**Poses not appearing in Gallery**
```
✓ Confirm files exist in poses/ directory
✓ Verify JSON is valid (use online JSON validator)
✓ Check file extension is .json (case-sensitive on Linux)
✓ Restart ComfyUI to trigger discovery
✓ Check browser console (F12) for error messages
```

**JSON import fails**
```
✓ Validate JSON structure (must have "pose_keypoints_2d" or equivalent)
✓ Ensure coordinates are valid numbers, not strings
✓ Confirm minimum 18 keypoints for body poses
✓ Check for malformed escape sequences in JSON
```

**Blank output image**
```
✓ Verify pose is selected and contains valid keypoints
✓ Check canvas dimensions (width/height) are reasonable (100-2048px)
✓ Click Apply to render after making changes
✓ Check for NaN or infinite values in coordinates
```

**Background reference not persisting**
```
✓ Enable third-party cookies/storage in browser
✓ Check browser localStorage settings
✓ Try incognito mode to isolate issue
✓ Clear browser cache and try again
```

**Node not appearing in ComfyUI**
```
✓ Verify clone location: ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-openpose-studio
✓ Check __init__.py exists and imports correctly
✓ Restart ComfyUI fully (not just reload page)
✓ Check ComfyUI console for import errors
```
