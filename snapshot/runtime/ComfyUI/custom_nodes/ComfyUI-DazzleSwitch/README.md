Smart switch node for ComfyUI. Name your inputs, pick from a dropdown, no more noodle spaghetti.

## Overview

DazzleSwitch routes any ComfyUI data type through a user-selected dropdown instead of requiring noodle rearrangement. Connect multiple inputs, name them, and select which one passes through — all from a dropdown widget. An INT override input enables programmatic cascading: one upstream value drives multiple switches.

### Comparison with rgthree Any Switch

| | rgthree Any Switch | DazzleSwitch |
|---|---|---|
| Selection | First non-None (implicit) | Dropdown widget (explicit) |
| Fallback behavior | Always top-down priority | Configurable: priority / strict / sequential |
| Input count | Dynamic (starts 5, min 4) | Dynamic (starts 3, min 3) |
| Input order matters | Yes (top wins) | Depends on mode (user picks in strict) |
| Renaming slots | Not used | Core feature (labels in dropdown) |
| Label persistence | N/A | Labels survive disconnect/reconnect |
| Type detection | None | Shows detected type of selected input |
| Programmatic control | None | INT override input |
| Chaining | Not possible | Chain INT to drive multiple switches |
| Slot reordering | Not supported | Right-click Move Up/Down |
| Active indicator | None | Green tint on selected slot |

## Features

- **Dropdown Selection**: Choose which input to route via a labeled dropdown, or select `(none)` to let mode decide
- **Fallback Modes**: Configurable behavior when selected input is unavailable — priority (rgthree-style), strict (no fallback), or sequential (next slot)
- **Dynamic Inputs**: Slots grow when you connect the last one, shrink when trailing slots disconnect (minimum 3)
- **Type-Agnostic**: Works with MODEL, CLIP, LATENT, IMAGE, MASK, STRING, or any other type
- **Type Detection**: Output label shows the detected type of the selected input (e.g., "MODEL" instead of "*")
- **Named Inputs**: Rename input slots (right-click → Rename) and see names in the dropdown
- **Label Cache**: Slot labels persist across disconnect/reconnect cycles — no need to re-rename
- **Active Slot Highlight**: Semi-transparent green tint shows which input is currently selected
- **Slot Reordering**: Right-click → Move Up/Down to rearrange input positions for [cascading alignment](https://github.com/DazzleNodes/ComfyUI-DazzleSwitch/issues/7)
- **INT Override**: `select_override` input (0=dropdown, 1+=programmatic selection)
- **Cascading**: Wire one INT value to multiple DazzleSwitch nodes for single-edit cascade
- **DazzleNodes Compatible**: Works standalone or as part of the [DazzleNodes](https://github.com/DazzleNodes) collection

## Prerequisites

```

Then restart ComfyUI or use **Manager → Refresh Node Definitions**.

### Manual Installation

1. Download the [latest release](https://github.com/DazzleNodes/ComfyUI-DazzleSwitch/releases)
2. Extract to `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/ComfyUI-DazzleSwitch/`
3. Restart ComfyUI
4. Find the node in: **DazzleNodes → Dazzle Switch**

## Usage

### Inputs

| Input | Type | Required | Description |
|-------|------|----------|-------------|
| select | Dropdown | Yes | Which connected input to route. Select `(none)` to let mode decide. |
| mode | Dropdown | Yes | Fallback behavior: priority, strict, or sequential |
| select_override | INT | No | Programmatic override (0=dropdown, 1+=select input by number) |
| input_01, input_02, ... | Any | No | Data inputs — connect any type. New slots appear as you connect. |

### Outputs

| Output | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| output | Any | The selected input value (type label shows detected type) |
| selected_index | INT | 1-based index of which input was selected (0 if none) |

### Resolution Chain

1. **INT override > 0**: Try `input_{override}` if connected
2. **Dropdown selection** (unless `(none)`): Try the dropdown-selected input
3. **Mode fallback**: Apply the chosen mode when steps 1-2 miss

### Fallback Modes

When the selected input is unavailable, the **mode** widget determines what happens next:

| Mode | Behavior | Use case |
|------|----------|----------|
| **priority** | First non-None from top (input_01 down) | rgthree-style "top wins" |
| **strict** | No fallback — returns (None, 0) | Explicit control, no surprises |
| **sequential** | Next slot after requested, wrapping around | Round-robin / ordered cycling |

### The (none) Option

The dropdown always includes a `(none)` option. Selecting it tells the node: "I don't have a preference — let the mode decide." This skips step 2 of the resolution chain entirely.

| Dropdown | Mode | Result |
|----------|------|--------|
| `(none)` | priority | First non-None from top (true rgthree behavior) |
| `(none)` | strict | Override only — nothing else |
| `(none)` | sequential | Scan from top, first non-None |
| input_XX | priority | Try input_XX, then first from top |
| input_XX | strict | Try input_XX, then nothing |
| input_XX | sequential | Try input_XX, then next slot down |

### Common Use Cases

#### A/B Switching
Connect two models/images/LoRAs and pick from the dropdown:
```
[Model A] → input_01 ("Base Model")
[Model B] → input_02 ("Fine-tuned")
                         ↓ select: "Base Model"
                    [DazzleSwitch] → output → [KSampler]
```

#### Cascading Selection
Wire one switch's `selected_index` to another's `select_override` so they change together:
```
[DazzleSwitch A] ─ selected_index → select_override ─ [DazzleSwitch B]
```

When you pick "Style B" (position 2) on Switch A, Switch B automatically selects its position 2 as well. This lets you control multiple switches from a single dropdown.

You can also drive multiple switches from a plain INT widget:
```
[INT Widget: 2] → select_override → [DazzleSwitch A] (selects position 2)
                → select_override → [DazzleSwitch B] (selects position 2)
                → select_override → [DazzleSwitch C] (selects position 2)
```

#### Aligning Positions Across Chained Switches

When chained switches have different inputs, the same position number may mean different things:

```
Switch A:                        Switch B:
  1: "Reference Image"            1: "Toggle"         ← wrong match!
  2: "Alt Image"                  2: "Inpaint Mask"
                                  3: "Flux Prompt"
                                  4: "Reference Image" ← this is what you want at position 1
```

To fix this, **right-click any input slot** and use **Move Up / Move Down** to reorder it. Moving "Reference Image" to position 1 on Switch B makes the cascade work correctly:

```
Switch B (after reorder):
  1: "Reference Image"  ← now matches Switch A position 1
  2: "Toggle"
  3: "Inpaint Mask"
  4: "Flux Prompt"
```

Connections, labels, and override indices all follow the slot when it moves — no need to disconnect and reconnect noodles.

> **Future: Named Channels** — Slot reordering is a manual workaround. A future release will add string-based cascading (`selected_key` / `select_key_override`) so switches can match by label name instead of position, eliminating the need to align slot order entirely. See [#7](https://github.com/DazzleNodes/ComfyUI-DazzleSwitch/issues/7) for the design discussion.

#### Dynamic Multi-Input Routing
Connect as many inputs as you need — the node grows automatically:
```
[LoRA 1] → input_01 ("Style A")
[LoRA 2] → input_02 ("Style B")
[LoRA 3] → input_03 ("Style C")    ← connecting here creates input_04
[LoRA 4] → input_04 ("Style D")    ← connecting here creates input_05
```
