"""Split one region mask into two: along a line the user drew (cut_mask), or automatically (split_mask).

cut_mask carries the drawn line on straight past both ends and divides the region by which side of it each pixel
lies on, so a short line across the narrowest part is enough.

split_mask is for a left/right pair selected as one region (two breasts, two legs, a torso): it treats the region as
one shape however many pieces it is made of, and cuts it by one smooth line between the two halves. The line starts
on the shape's mirror axis (mirror_axis: the line it is most nearly symmetric about, whatever its proportions) and
bends to follow a crease where one runs nearby: a dark line in the art, or a gap between two pieces (SAM stops at
line art, so two breasts clicked separately meet at a gap). Lines that veer off (the outlines either side of the V
above a cleavage) are let go, so a chunk between two parts is cut down its middle. The line is the cheapest path
through the band either side of the axis (dynamic programming over rows of a frame rotated to the axis). A region
that is not such a pair (a near leg and the far one seen from the side) is cut along a line the user draws instead.
